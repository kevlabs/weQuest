### Features
- Single Page Application using React and Ionic
- Users can request items for short-term rental
- Users who own the requested products are able to bid on the aforementioned requests through a reverse auction mechanism
- As no two bids are the same, the requester is presented with all bids and selects a winner
- All other users' requests are shown in the request feed. This is the landing page. It showcases the app's concepts.
- Users can see their history in the activity feed
- Live updates using socket.io (current auction price, notifications...)
